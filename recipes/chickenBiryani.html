    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p class="desc">Biryani is a mixed rice dish originating in South Asia, traditionally made with rice,
       meat (chicken, goat, beef) or seafood (prawns or fish), vegetables, and spices. It was present 
       in Mughal-era India, though the precise date and place of origin are debated.[1] It is 
       thought to derive from a Persian rice dish, either pilau or birinj biryan.[1][2][3] The 
       historian of food Lizzie Collingham states that the dish makes use of slow-cooking as in 
       Persian pilau, combined with Persian-style yoghurt-marinated meat and a spicy Indian style 
       of cooking; she suggests the dish was developed in the Mughal court kitchens.[1] It is also 
       possible that biryani was brought to South India before the Mughal era, or that pilau was 
       brought to India and biryani was developed from it before being adopted by the Mughals.
